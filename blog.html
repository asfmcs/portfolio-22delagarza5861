<p> The first day of Computer Science Honors for me was honestly super interesting, I was learning totally new things that I had never ever seen before, I am glad that I choose this honors class beacuse it really chalenges me. <br>
<br>
Next, I honestly thought the class was going to be different that what it actually is, I did not know what bits were and that they involved some type of math, so that was very surprising for me </p>

  <p> In our class for the first units of the class there was a lot of teamwork involved, for example, we did a timeline about computers in parters, a presentation about codes around the world and many other things 
    <br>
    <br>
    In conlcusion, having teamwork in a Computer Science class was something that I would never ever imagine, but having it was actually very great, beacuse as partners we found out more things and collaborrated in a great way

  <p> Khan Academy was a great help for us students this unit beacuse of the way the things are taught, every lesson has many many little projects where we get to apply what we have just learned and helps us remember them.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also, having Khan Academy is great for learning CSS and HTML beacuse they make it seem very easy but still amke it fun. I learned how to crate a website with many things such as fonts, tables, colors, pictures, external links, bold font, italics, breaks, paragraphs, headings etc in just a single hour of Khan Academy lesson.
