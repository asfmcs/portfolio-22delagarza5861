<h2> Culture in Shanghai </h2>

    <p> <strong>Due to its colonial history, Shanghai has a unique architectural heritage. </strong> Its Bund waterfront is lined with nineteenth and early twentieth-century Western architecture; in particular Shanghai has an impressive collection of Art Deco buildings. Its lilong (lane) neighbourhoods incorporate Shikumen houses which blend Western and Eastern influences. But Shanghai’s rapid development is threatening its built heritage. There is now an increasing interest in historic preservation, either through restoring heritage sites or rebuilding them after their destruction. <br>
<br>
Shanghai is a city under rapid development, aiming to become an international cultural capital. Its government sees culture as an important driver of economic growth: hence the development of the creative industries and cultural clusters are a priority. Cultural infrastructure – from local libraries to internationally recognised museums – is rapidly being built. </p>

<h2> The Bund Finance Center </h2>
<img src="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/59df/ade1/b22e/3832/8500/0193/newsletter/581_Fosun_Foundation_at_street_level_Bund_Finance_Centre_CREDIT_Laurian_Ghinitoiu.jpg?1507831257" alt="The Bund Finance Center" Width="500">
<p> <strong> The social focus of the scheme is the cultural centre, conceived as a platform for international arts and cultural exchange, as well as a place for brand events, product launches and corporate functions. </strong> The building is encircled by a moving veil, which adapts to the changing use of the building and reveals the stage on the balcony and views towards Pudong. Developed in collaboration with local engineers Tongji University, the façade is a veil organised along three tracks and made up of layers of 675 individual magnesium alloy ‘tassels’ – a reference to the traditional Chinese bridal headdress. The tassels range in length from around 2 metres to 16 metres so that as each track independently moves, the veil rotates with the tassels overlapping and producing different visual effects and levels of opacity. </p>

<p> <strong> Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center in the downtown is the largest urban planning exhibition hall and is a popular museum for Shanghai new-visitors, since it shows the past historical development, the current situation and the future planning of this city with the advanced techniques. </strong> <br> 
One if its most visited floors is the third floor, the main floor of the building called “Hall of Master Plans”, visitors will see the centerpiece of all exhibits in the building — the Model of the Downtown Area of Central Shanghai. There you can see the existing Shanghai and future Shanghai vividly by walking around the model on walkways. Or a better way is to go up to a gallery running around the big model and take a full view from above. On the same floor there is a Circular-Screen Demonstration Hall with a 360° screen. <h6> <em> Sources: https://www.shanghaihighlights.com/shanghai-sightseeing/urban-planning-exhibition-hall.htm;https://www.chinadiscovery.com/shanghai/shanghai-urban-planning-exhibition-center.html </em> </h6> </p>


<h2> Shanghai Natural History Museum </h2>

<p> <strong>  The much anticipated Shanghai Natural History Museum, designed by Perkins+Will’s Global Design Director Ralph Johnson, has opened in Shanghai.</strong> The 44,517 square meter (479,180 square foot) museum offers visitors the opportunity to explore the natural world through the display of more than 10,000 artifacts from all seven continents. The building includes exhibit spaces, a 4D theater, an outdoor exhibit garden, and a 30-meter tall atrium that welcomes visitors with an abundance of natural light filtered through a striking glass wall inspired by the cellular structure of plants and animals. <br>
<br>  Perkins+Will was selected following an international design competition that included entries from some of the world’s best known architects. The overall shape and building organization was inspired by the nautilus shell, one of the purest geometric forms found in nature. Natural elements are depicted across the building’s façades including the central cell wall representing the cellular structure of plants and animals, the east living wall signifying earth’s vegetation, and the northern stone wall suggesting shifting tectonic plates and canyon walls eroded by rivers. <h6> <em> Source: https://www.archdaily.com/623197/shanghai-natural-history-museum-perkins-will </em> </h6> </p>

<h2>Shanghai Museum of Glass </h2>
<img src="http://online.wsj.com/media/crt_glass_museum_G_20110523043609.jpg" alt="Shnaghai Museum of Glass" Width="500">
<p> <strong> People are happy to visit a regular museum for short periods of time due to convenience; however, it would be challenging to expect someone invest over two hours by car or bus to visit a museum for only an hour.</strong> Another key feature of type two museums is that they are multifunctional; they must provide enough activities and entertainment to attract people to spend at least two hours or longer. In addition to its glass themed exhibition, the Shanghai Museum of Glass does this through its’ hot glass shows, DIY workshops, lectures, libraries, and other interactive activities all designed to attract and educate a variety of target groups creating value and incentive for people to visit. <br>
<br> The Shanghai Museum of Glass multifunctional design combines exhibitions with hot glass shows, DIY workshops, lectures, libraries, restaurants, coffees, events, shops, public space and so on. Its’ sustainable adaptive reuse design and modern feel incorporate old and new ideas making it the first of its’ kind in China. The Entrance Plaza is the face of the museum enabling immediate recognition and recall for visitors where it guides people into the museum, hot glass show and surrounding areas. The new entrance building stands on the Entrance Plaza acting as a welcoming platform for the museum. <h6> <em>Source: https://www.archdaily.com/144236/shanghai-museum-of-glass-logon-architecture </em> </h6>
